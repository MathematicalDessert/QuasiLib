# QuasiLib
## General C++ library of methods and functions I deem useful

### What is QuasiLib?

QuasiLib is a barebones library of useful functions and classes I generally end up needing but can never find any suitable libaries online. With the 'Quasi' implying constant change.

**DISCLAIMER:** I do not know what other compilers this project will work for. Only tested with Visual Studio 2017. 

### Can you use QuasiLib for yourself?

Yes you can, I do not mind people using the library how the wish provided they do not plagerise the code, passing it off as their own.

### Can I contribute to QuasiLib?

Well, this one is a bit more hazy - if you think you have something that is worth looking at just push it to this repo and I'll take a glance and merge or give you some feedback on your code
